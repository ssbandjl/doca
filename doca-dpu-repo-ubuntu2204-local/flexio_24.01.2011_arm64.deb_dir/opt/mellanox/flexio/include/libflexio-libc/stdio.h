    \code #include <stdio.h> \endcode

    <h3>Introduction to the Standard IO facilities</h3>

    This file declares the standard IO facilities that are implemented
    in \c flexio-libc.  Due to the nature of the underlying hardware,
    only a limited subset of standard IO is implemented.  There is no
    actual file implementation available, so only device IO can be
    performed.  Since there's no operating system, the application
    needs to provide enough details about their devices in order to
    make them usable by the standard IO facilities.

    Due to space constraints, some functionality has not been
    implemented at all (like some of the \c printf conversions that
    have been left out).  Nevertheless, potential users of this
    implementation should be warned: the \c printf and \c scanf families of functions, although
    usually associated with presumably simple things like the
    famous "Hello, world!" program, are actually fairly complex
    which causes their inclusion to eat up a fair amount of code space.
    Also, they are not fast due to the nature of interpreting the
    format string at run-time.  Whenever possible, resorting to the
    (sometimes non-standard) predetermined conversion facilities that are
    offered by flexio-libc will usually cost much less in terms of speed
    and code size.

    <h3>Tunable options for code size vs. feature set</h3>

    In order to allow programmers a code size vs. functionality tradeoff,
    the function vfprintf() which is the heart of the printf family can be
    selected in different flavours using linker options.  See the
    documentation of vfprintf() for a detailed description.  The same
    applies to vfscanf() and the \c scanf family of functions.

    <h3>Outline of the chosen API</h3>

    The standard streams \c stdin, \c stdout, and \c stderr are
    provided, but contrary to the C standard, since flexio-libc has no
    knowledge about applicable devices, these streams are not already
    pre-initialized at application startup.  Also, since there is no
    notion of "file" whatsoever to flexio-libc, there is no function
    \c fopen() that could be used to associate a stream to some device.
    (See \ref stdio_note1 "note 1".)  Instead, the function \c fdevopen()
    is provided to associate a stream to a device, where the device
    needs to provide a function to send a character, to receive a
    character, or both.  There is no differentiation between "text" and
    "binary" streams inside flexio-libc.  Character \c \\n is sent
    literally down to the device's \c put() function.  If the device
    requires a carriage return (\c \\r) character to be sent before
    the linefeed, its \c put() routine must implement this (see
    \ref stdio_note2 "note 2").

    As an alternative method to fdevopen(), the macro
    fdev_setup_stream() might be used to setup a user-supplied FILE
    structure.

    It should be noted that the automatic conversion of a newline
    character into a carriage return - newline sequence breaks binary
    transfers.  If binary transfers are desired, no automatic
    conversion should be performed, but instead any string that aims
    to issue a CR-LF sequence must use <tt>"\r\n"</tt> explicitly.

    stdin, stdout and stderr are undefined global FILE pointers. If
    you want to use this, your application must define these variables
    and initialize them. They are declared 'const' so that you can place
    them in ROM if you don't need to modify it after startup. FILEs
    cannot be placed in ROM as they have values which are modified
    during runtime.

    \anchor stdio_without_malloc
    <h3>Running stdio without malloc()</h3>

    By default, fdevopen() requires malloc().  As this is often
    not desired in the limited environment of a microcontroller, an
    alternative option is provided to run completely without malloc().

    The macro fdev_setup_stream() is provided to prepare a
    user-supplied FILE buffer for operation with stdio.

    <h4>Example</h4>

    \code
    #include <stdio.h>

    static int uart_putchar(char c, FILE *stream);

    static FILE mystdout = FDEV_SETUP_STREAM(uart_putchar, NULL,
                                             _FDEV_SETUP_WRITE);

    static int
    uart_putchar(char c, FILE *stream)
    {

      if (c == '\n')
        uart_putchar('\r', stream);
      loop_until_bit_is_set(UCSRA, UDRE);
      UDR = c;
      return 0;
    }

    int
    main(void)
    {
      init_uart();
      stdout = &mystdout;
      printf("Hello, world!\n");

      return 0;
    }
    \endcode

    This example uses the initializer form FDEV_SETUP_STREAM() rather
    than the function-like fdev_setup_stream(), so all data
    initialization happens during C start-up.

    If streams initialized that way are no longer needed, they can be
    destroyed by first calling the macro fdev_close(), and then
    destroying the object itself.  No call to fclose() should be
    issued for these streams.  While calling fclose() itself is
    harmless, it will cause an undefined reference to free() and thus
    cause the linker to link the malloc module into the application.

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    \anchor stdio_note1 \par Note 1:
    It might have been possible to implement a device abstraction that
    is compatible with \c fopen() but since this would have required
    to parse a string, and to take all the information needed either
    out of this string, or out of an additional table that would need to be
    provided by the application, this approach was not taken.

    \anchor stdio_note2 \par Note 2:
    This basically follows the Unix approach: if a device such as a
    terminal needs special handling, it is in the domain of the
    terminal device driver to provide this functionality.  Thus, a
    simple function suitable as \c put() for \c fdevopen() that talks
    to a UART interface might look like this:

    \code
    int
    uart_putchar(char c, FILE *stream)
    {

      if (c == '\n')
        uart_putchar('\r', stream);
      loop_until_bit_is_set(UCSRA, UDRE);
      UDR = c;
      return 0;
    }
    \endcode

    \anchor stdio_note3 \par Note 3:
    This implementation has been chosen because the cost of maintaining
    an alias is considerably smaller than the cost of maintaining full
    copies of each stream.  Yet, providing an implementation that offers
    the complete set of standard streams was deemed to be useful.  Not
    only that writing \c printf() instead of <tt>fprintf(mystream, ...)</tt>
    saves typing work, but since the compiler needs to resort to pass all
    arguments of variadic functions on the stack (as opposed to passing
    them in registers for functions that take a fixed number of
    parameters), the ability to pass one parameter less by implying
    \c stdin or stdout will also save some execution time.

/**
   \c vfprintf is the central facility of the \c printf family of
   functions.  It outputs values to \c stream under control of a
   format string passed in \c fmt.  The actual values to print are
   passed as a variable argument list \c ap.

   \c vfprintf returns the number of characters written to \c stream,
   or \c EOF in case of an error.  Currently, this will only happen
   if \c stream has not been opened with write intent.

   The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
   characters (not \c %), which are copied unchanged to the output
   stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
   fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion
   specification is introduced by the \c % character.  The arguments must
   properly correspond (after type promotion) with the conversion
   specifier.  After the \c %, the following appear in sequence:

   - Zero or more of the following flags:
      <ul>
      <li> \c # The value should be converted to an "alternate form".  For
            c, d, i, s, and u conversions, this option has no effect.
            For o conversions, the precision of the number is
            increased to force the first character of the output
            string to a zero (except if a zero value is printed with
            an explicit precision of zero).  For x and X conversions,
            a non-zero result has the string `0x' (or `0X' for X
            conversions) prepended to it.</li>
      <li> \c 0 (zero) Zero padding.  For all conversions, the converted
            value is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks.
            If a precision is given with a numeric conversion (d, i,
            o, u, i, x, and X), the 0 flag is ignored.</li>
      <li> \c - A negative field width flag; the converted value is to be
            left adjusted on the field boundary.  The converted value
            is padded on the right with blanks, rather than on the
            left with blanks or zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are
            given.</li>
      <li> ' ' (space) A blank should be left before a positive number
            produced by a signed conversion (d, or i).</li>
      <li> \c + A sign must always be placed before a number produced by a
            signed conversion.  A + overrides a space if both are
            used.</li>
      </ul>

   -   An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum field width.
       If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it
       will be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment
       flag has been given) to fill out the field width.
   -   An optional precision, in the form of a period . followed by an
       optional digit string.  If the digit string is omitted, the
       precision is taken as zero.  This gives the minimum number of
       digits to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, or the
       maximum number of characters to be printed from a string for \c s
       conversions.
   -   An optional \c l or \c h length modifier, that specifies that the
       argument for the d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion is a \c "long int"
       rather than \c int. The \c h is ignored, as \c "short int" is
       equivalent to \c int.
   -   A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.

   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

   - \c diouxX The int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted
           to signed decimal (d and i), unsigned octal (o), unsigned
           decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.
           The letters "abcdef" are used for x conversions; the
           letters "ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The
           precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that
           must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits,
           it is padded on the left with zeros.
   - \c p  The <tt>void *</tt> argument is taken as an unsigned integer,
           and converted similarly as a <tt>%\#x</tt> command would do.
   - \c c  The \c int argument is converted to an \c "unsigned char", and the
           resulting character is written.
   - \c s  The \c "char *" argument is expected to be a pointer to an array
           of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from
           the array are written up to (but not including) a
           terminating NUL character; if a precision is specified, no
           more than the number specified are written.  If a precision
           is given, no null character need be present; if the
           precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of
           the array, the array must contain a terminating NUL
           character.
   - \c %  A \c % is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete
           conversion specification is "%%".
   - \c eE The double argument is rounded and converted in the format
           \c "[-]d.ddde±dd" where there is one digit before the
           decimal-point character and the number of digits after it
           is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it
           is taken as 6; if the precision is zero, no decimal-point
           character appears.  An \e E conversion uses the letter \c 'E'
           (rather than \c 'e') to introduce the exponent.  The exponent
           always contains two digits; if the value is zero,
           the exponent is 00.
   - \c fF The double argument is rounded and converted to decimal notation
           in the format \c "[-]ddd.ddd", where the number of digits after the
           decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification.
           If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision
           is explicitly zero, no decimal-point character appears.  If a
           decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.
   - \c gG The double argument is converted in style \c f or \c e (or
           \c F or \c E for \c G conversions).  The precision
           specifies the number of significant digits.  If the
           precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision
           is zero, it is treated as 1.  Style \c e is used if the
           exponent from its conversion is less than -4 or greater
           than or equal to the precision.  Trailing zeros are removed
           from the fractional part of the result; a decimal point
           appears only if it is followed by at least one digit.
   - \c S  Similar to the \c s format, except the pointer is expected to
           point to a program-memory (ROM) string instead of a RAM string.

   In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
   numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field
   width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.

   Since the full implementation of all the mentioned features becomes
   fairly large, three different flavours of vfprintf() can be
   selected using linker options.  The default vfprintf() implements
   all the mentioned functionality except floating point conversions.
   A minimized version of vfprintf() is available that only implements
   the very basic integer and string conversion facilities, but only
   the \c # additional option can be specified using conversion
   flags (these flags are parsed correctly from the format
   specification, but then simply ignored).  This version can be
   requested using the following \ref gcc_minusW "compiler options":

   \code
   -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_min
   \endcode

   \par Limitations:
   - The specified width and precision can be at most 255.

   \par Notes:
   - Floating point is not supported in flexio-libc
   - The \c hh length modifier is ignored (\c char argument is
     promouted to \c int). More exactly, this realization does not check
     the number of \c h symbols.
   - But the \c ll length modifier will to abort the output, as this
     realization does not operate \c long \c long arguments.
   - The variable width or precision field (an asterisk \c * symbol)
     is not realized and will to abort the output.
