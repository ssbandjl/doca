 * This call will fail if PD was acquired by DOCA through doca_devinfo_create_list()
 * and then doca_rdma_bridge_get_dev_pd()
 *
 * This API should be used only to bridge between rdma-core and DOCA, to allow them to share memory registrations
 * E.g., application already has logic that utilizes an ibv_pd, to read and write memory using RDMA, and wants to
 * extend the logic by using libraries in DOCA, but such libraries will require a doca_dev and doca_buf instead of an
 * ibv_pd and mkey in order to read write same memory. Then this method can be used to get a doca_dev that can
 * be added to a doca_mmap, such that any doca_buf created from the doca_mmap can yield mkeys that are associated
 * with the same ibv_pd using doca_rdma_bridge_get_buf_mkey()
 *
 * For reference:
 * doca_dev - is parallel to an ibv_pd
 * doca_buf - is parallel to an ibv_mr registered on multiple devices
 * doca_mmap - is parallel to creating an ibv_mr for multiple devices
 *
 * The only APIs that are supported for the newly created device:
 * - doca_dev_close()
 * - doca_rdma_bridge_get_buf_mkey()
 * - doca_rdma_bridge_get_dev_pd()
 *
 * @param [in] pd
 * A protection domain that is not associated with any DOCA device
