/**
 * A partial hash task allows the SHA calculation to be broken up into multiple steps. This allows for calculating the
 * SHA as more data becomes available or to calculate the SHA of very large data. This is achieved by allocating a
 * partial hash task once then submitting it multiple times. Each time the partial task is completed the user will
 * update the source buffer to point to the next section of data and then resubmit the task effectively iterating over
 * the input data until it has all be submitted to the partial hash task. To get the final calculated SHA result the
 * user must know when the data pointed to by the source buffer is the last segment of data and mark the task as final
 * by making a call to:
 *     doca_sha_task_partial_hash_set_is_final_buf.
 * Once the final buffer of the task has completed successfully the destination buffer will hold the computed SHA of
 * the data as if it has been processed in one go. From here the user may choose to either release the task or reset
 * it and start the process over once again. To reset the task to start again the user can call:
 *     doca_sha_task_partial_hash_reset
 *
 * Note: Partial hash task source buffers have additional constraints on the source buffer then are imposed for a
 * regular hash task:
 *
 * 1) All non-final source buffers must have a size which is an exact multiple of the SHA block size for the given
 *    device and algorithm. See: doca_sha_cap_get_partial_hash_block_size
 *
 *    Note: The additional constraints do NOT apply to the final source buffer and it only has to adhere to the
