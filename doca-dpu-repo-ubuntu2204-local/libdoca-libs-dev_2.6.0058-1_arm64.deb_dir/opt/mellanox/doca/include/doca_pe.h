 * - release task with doca_task_free(); task object ownership passed to DOCA
 * - keep the task object for future re-use; user keeps the ownership on the task object. All tasks MUST be freed before

 * Inside this callback the user shouldn't call doca_pe_progress().
 * Please see doca_pe_progress for details.
