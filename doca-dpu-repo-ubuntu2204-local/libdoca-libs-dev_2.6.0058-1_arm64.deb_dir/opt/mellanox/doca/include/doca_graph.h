 *
 * DOCA graph facilitates submitting an ordered set of tasks and user callbacks.
 * A graph can contain nodes of the following types:
 * - Context node: A node that points to a context and contains a doca_task for that context.
 * -- A graph must contain at least one context node.
 * - User node: A node that points to a callback supplied by the user and contains a user defined doca_task.
 * - Graph node: A node that points to a graph instance and facilitates building a graph of graphs.
 *
 * Graph Instance
 * A graph creates a graph instance (or more)
 * Every node in the graph instance is set with corresponding data (task, callback, etc. depending on the type of the
 * node).
 * Node data can be set during runtime, but it is not recommended. Application should instead change the task content.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Create a graph by adding nodes and setting dependencies.
 * -- Cyclic graph is not permitted.
 * - Create graph instance (or more).
 * - Set nodes data to every graph instance.
 * - Submit graph instances
 * - Call progress one when applicable.
 *
 * Notes
 * - Any node failure shall fail the graph progress. However, the graph progress shall complete only when all in flight
 *   nodes are completed (new nodes shall not be submitted).
 * - A graph instance shall not fail if a context is overloaded (it will continue running once the context is free).
 *
 * @code
 * Graph example (diamond graph):
 *                         +-------------+
 *                         |    Node A   |
 *                         +-------------+
 *                                |
 *                +---------------+---------------+

 * Graph implementation example:
 * This example builds a graph with 2 nodes, creates an instance and submits it to a progress engine.
 * node1 -> node2
 * The example is focused on the graph API. It does not include progress engine, contexts creation etc. or error handling.
 *
 * Create the graph and connect it to a progress engine.
 *	struct doca_graph *my_graph;
 *	doca_graph_create(pe, &my_graph);
 *	doca_graph_set_conf(my_graph, graph_completion_cb, graph_error_cb, log_num_instances);
 *
 * Create the nodes
 *	struct doca_graph_node *node1, node2;
 *	doca_graph_node_create_from_ctx(my_graph, ctx1, &node1);
 *	doca_graph_node_create_from_ctx(my_graph, ctx2, &node2);
 *
 * Set dependency (node1 -> node2)
 *	doca_graph_add_dependency(my_graph, node1, node2);
 *
 * Start the graph
 *	doca_graph_start(my_graph);
 *
 * Create a graph instance and set nodes data
 *	struct doca_graph_instance *my_graph_instance
 *	doca_graph_instance_create(my_graph, &my_graph_instance);
 *	doca_graph_instance_set_ctx_node_data(my_graph_instance, node1, &node_1_task);
 *	doca_graph_instance_set_ctx_node_data(my_graph_instance, node2, &node_2_task);
 *
 * Submit the graph instance to the progress engine
 *	doca_graph_instance_submit(my_graph_instance);
 *
 * Call progress one to tick the progress engine until graph is completed (graph instance completed callback will be
 * invoked).
 *	doca_pe_progress(pe);
 *
 * Resubmit instance
 *	Set tasks parameters if required.
 *	doca_graph_instance_submit(my_graph_instance);
