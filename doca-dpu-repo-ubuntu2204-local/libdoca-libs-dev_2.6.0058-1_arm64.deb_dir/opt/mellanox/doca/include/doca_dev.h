 * @brief Check if a PCI address belongs to a DOCA devinfo_rep.
 *
 * @param [in] devinfo_rep
 * The representor of device to query.
 * @param [in] pci_addr_str
 * The PCI address to check, should be as one of the following formats:
 * - "Domain:Bus:Device.Function", e.g., "0000:3a:00.0" (size DOCA_DEVINFO_PCI_ADDR_SIZE including a null terminator).
 * - "Bus:Device.Function", e.g., "3a:00.0" (size DOCA_DEVINFO_PCI_BDF_SIZE including a null terminator).
 * @param [out] is_equal
 * 1 if pci_addr_str belongs to devinfo_rep, 0 otherwise.
 *
 * @return
 * DOCA_SUCCESS - in case of success.
 * Error code - in case of failure:
 * - DOCA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE - received invalid input.
 * - DOCA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED - local device does not expose representor devices,
 *     or dev was created by doca_rdma_bridge_open_dev_from_pd()
 * - DOCA_ERROR_NO_MEMORY - not enough memory to generate devinfo_rep PCI address for comparison.
 * - DOCA_ERROR_UNEXPECTED - an unexpected error occurred.
