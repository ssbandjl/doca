/**
 * struct snap_migration_ops - completion handle and callback
 * for live migration support
 *
 * This structure should be allocated by the snap-controller and can be
 * passed to communication primitives.
 *
 * In order to fulfil the above requirements, each SNAP controller must
 * implement basic migration operations. Since these operations are generic,
 * it will be passed during the creation of the snap_device that will create
 * an internal communication channel. Using these callbacks, the internal
 * communication channel will be able to master the migration process for the
 * controller that is represented by this snap_device. By passing these
 * callbacks, each SNAP controller actually gives supervisor permissions to the
 * communication channel to change its operational states, save/restore the
 * internal controller state and start/stop dirty pages tracking.
 *
 * @quiesce: This operation will stop the device from issuing DMA requests.
 * Once successfully returned, the device is not allowed to initiate any
 * operation that might dirty new pages nor changing other devices state.
 * The device can still receive requests that might change its internal state.
 * @unquiesce: This operation is counterpart of the quiesce operation.
 * Once successfully returned, the device is allowed issuing DMA operations
 * and change other devices state.
 * @freeze: This operation will notify the device to stop reacting to incoming
 * requests.Once successfully returned, the device internal state is not
 * allowed to change until it is unfreezed again.
 * @unfreeze: This operation is counterpart of the freeze operation.
 * Once successfully returned, the device is allowed to react to incoming
 * requests that might change its internal state.
 * @get_state_size: Query for internal device state size. In case the
 * controller is unfreezed, device state can be changed. Controllers that
 * don't support tracking for state changes while running will return 0 for
 * this query unless device is freezed. For controllers that track internal
 * state while running, the implementation is controller specific.
 * The returned size, in bytes, will inform the migration SW on the upcoming
 * amount of data that should be copied from the controller.
 * @copy_state: This operation will be used to save and restore device state.
 * During "saving" procedure, the controller will copy the internal device
 * state to a given buffer. The migration SW will query the state size prior
 * running this operation during "saving" states.
 * During "restore" procedure, the migration SW will copy the migrated state to
 * the controller. In this stage, the controller must be freezed and quiesced.
 * @start_dirty_pages_track: This operation will be used to inform the
 * controller to start tracking and reporting dirty pages to the communication
 * channel. A controller can track dirty pages only while running. For live
 * migration, capable controllers should be able to start tracking dirty pages
 * during "Pre-copy" phase and stop tracking during "Stop-and-Copy" phase.
 * @stop_dirty_pages_track: This operation will be used to inform the
 * controller to stop tracking and reporting dirty pages. For live migration,
 * capable controllers should be able to start tracking dirty pages during
 * "Pre-copy" phase and stop tracking during "Stop-and-Copy" phase.
 *
 * @get_pci_bdf: This operation will be used to retrieve the PCI Bus/Device/Function
 *  presented to the hostfor the snap controller. In case of success,
 *  non 0 value will be returned. This value willrepresent the PCI BDF
 *  according to the commonly known structure of eight-bit PCI Bus,five-bit
 *  Device and three-bit Function. In case of an error or in case the host
 *  still didn'tenumerate the PCI device, 0 value will be returned.This
 *  knowledge might be useful for creating a discovery mechanism between
 *  migrationSW and SNAP channels.
 *
 * @get_lm_state: This operation will be used to retrieve current live migration
 * state of the snap controller. A migration channel can use it to recover its
 * state after abnormal disconnect or for the debug purposes.
