/* The macro is used to serialize stores across Normal NC (or Device) and WB
 * memory, (see Arm Spec, B2.7.2).  Based on recent changes in Linux kernel:
 * https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=22ec71615d824f4f11d38d0e55a88d8956b7e45f
 *
 * The underlying barrier code was changed to use lighter weight DMB instead
 * of DSB. The barrier used for synchronization of access between write back
 * and device mapped memory (PCIe BAR).
 *
 * According to vkleiner@nvidia.com
 * - improvements of around couple-hundreds kIOPS (more or less, depending
 *   on the workload) for 8 active BlueField cores with the following change
 * - improvement to parallel fraction on 512B test
